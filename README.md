# Golang Sidecar Service for the Outbox Pattern
## Overview

The [Outbox Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html#:~:text=A%20service%20command%20typically%20needs,13%20and%20publish%20an%20event) is a microservice design pattern that ensures atomicity between database operations and message publishing​.
​

* The outbox addresses the problem of reliably updating data and sending events without using distributed transactions. In this pattern, the application writes domain changes and an event record to an outbox table in the same transaction. 
* A separate process then reads from the outbox and publishes events to a message broker, guaranteeing that if the database commit succeeds, the event will eventually be delivered​

​

This **sidecar service** is a **Go** implementation of the `Outbox Pattern`, designed to run alongside a primary application. 
It monitors the outbox table for new events and relays them to a messaging system with robust guarantees. 

### Key Features:

**Pluggable storage layer:** Supports multiple databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) behind a common interface.

**Extensible messaging brokers:** Supports RabbitMQ and Google Cloud Pub/Sub initially, with a flexible interface for others.

**Event-driven processing:** Uses event notifications from the database when possible, falling back to polling if needed.

**Configuration management:** Offers YAML and environment variable config with structured parsing and validation.

**Observability:** Integrates with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and metrics following industry best practices.

**Reliability:** Implements retries with exponential backoff, ensures idempotent message handling, and uses dead-letter queues for failures.

**Kubernetes-ready:** Runs as a sidecar container in the same Pod as the application, sharing lifecycle and resources.

## Architecture and Design


Outbox Pattern architecture: 

![](./docs/image.png)

The service’s business data and an outbox event are saved atomically **(1)**. 
<br/>
A separate sidecar process then reads the outbox **(2)** and publishes the event to a message broker **(3)**, ensuring reliable, eventual delivery. 
<br/>
<p>
The sidecar service runs alongside the main application in a separate container or process, forming a sidecar pattern deployment.
It has access to the same database as the application and operates continuously to forward outbox events. The main application, after performing its business logic (for example, creating an order), writes a new event record to the outbox table as part of the same transaction that modifies domain data. Once committed, the sidecar service will detect the outbox entry and publish a corresponding message to the configured message broker. This decoupling guarantees atomicity and prevents the dual-write problem where a database update could succeed but the message send fails (or vice versa)​

[dev.to](https://dev.to/trojan295/">docs.aws.amazon.com</a>)  (<a href="https://dev.to/trojan295/transactional-outbox-pattern-example-in-golang-and-mongodb-36mb#:~:text=One%20problem%20I%20had%20was,for%20example%2C%20an%20application%20crash">dev.to</a>)
​</p>
<br/>


In this design, the `Outbox Sidecar` is **event-driven** by default: it subscribes to notifications of new outbox records or change events from the database. If the underlying storage engine doesn’t support push notifications or if notifications are lost, the service falls back to polling the outbox table at a configurable interval. This ensures no events are missed even in absence of events or on crashes. The sidecar shares the same lifecycle as the main app – *“for each instance of the application, an instance of the sidecar is deployed and hosted alongside it”​* ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar#:~:text=A%20sidecar%20service%20isn%27t%20necessarily,deployed%20and%20hosted%20alongside%20it))


This co-location minimizes communication latency and allows the sidecar to reliably use local environment/configuration identical to the app’s. 

### Major components of the service include:
* **Outbox Repository Interface:** Abstracts the storage operations (querying new events, updating statuses, etc.) so multiple databases can be supported.
* **Message Broker Interface:** Abstracts the messaging system, enabling integration with different brokers by implementing a common publish API.
* **Outbox Processor:** Core engine that ties everything together, using either DB events or polling to retrieve outbox messages and dispatch them to a broker.
* **Configuration Loader:** Reads YAML or environment variables into a config struct, validating required fields.
* **Observability Hooks:** Instrumentation points for tracing and metrics (e.g. span around message processing, counters for processed messages)
* **Retry & DLQ Logic:** Handles retrying message sends with backoff, marking messages as sent or directing them to dead-letter channels after failures.


## Configuration Management

The sidecar service configurable, with support for `YAML` configuration files and `environment` variables. 

### Example: YAML Configuration for a Go Outbox Sidecar

This YAML file (`sidecar.development.yaml`) provides a clear, human-readable way to configure your Go outbox sidecar service for a development environment. It demonstrates how you can manage all critical settings in one place, making your application easy to deploy and maintain.


```yaml
database:
  type: postgres|spanner
  dsn: postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/appdb?sslmode=disable
broker:
  type: rabbitmq
  url: amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/
  exchange: outbox.dev
  poolSize: 10
poll_interval: 10s
batch_size: 100
max_retries: 5
retry_backoff: 2s
dead_letter_topic: dead-letter-topic
observability:
  service_name: test-service
  tracing_url: localhost:4318
  metrics_url: otel-collector:9090

```
### **Key Sections and What They Do**

#### **1. Database Configuration**
```yaml
database:
  type: postgres
  dsn: postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/appdb?sslmode=disable
```
- **type:** Specifies the database engine (here, PostgreSQL).
- **dsn:** The connection string for your database, including credentials and host.

#### **2. Broker Configuration**
```yaml
broker:
  type: rabbitmq
  url: amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/
  exchange: outbox.dev
  poolSize: 10
```
- **type:** The message broker to use (RabbitMQ in this case).
- **url:** Connection string for RabbitMQ.
- **exchange:** The exchange name for publishing messages.
- **poolSize:** Number of AMQP channels to pool for performance.

#### **3. Outbox Processing Settings**
```yaml
poll_interval: 10s
batch_size: 100
max_retries: 5
retry_backoff: 2s
dead_letter_topic: dead-letter-topic
```
- **poll_interval:** How often the sidecar polls for new outbox events.
- **batch_size:** Number of events to process in one batch.
- **max_retries:** Maximum number of delivery attempts before giving up.
- **retry_backoff:** Initial wait time before retrying a failed event.
- **dead_letter_topic:** Where to send events that can’t be delivered after all retries.

#### **4. Observability**
```yaml
observability:
  service_name: test-service
  tracing_url: localhost:4318
  metrics_url: otel-collector:9090
```
- **service_name:** Name for tracing and metrics.
- **tracing_url:** Endpoint for sending trace data (e.g., to OpenTelemetry).
- **metrics_url:** Endpoint for sending metrics.

**In summary:**  
This YAML config is a best-practice example for modern Go microservices, supporting clear separation of concerns, easy environment switching, and robust operational controls.

## Go Application Configuration  and Validation


### **Settings**

The `Settings` struct defines all the configuration options your application needs, including:
- **Database** and **Broker** settings (as nested structs)
- Polling intervals, batch size, retry logic
- Dead letter topic for failed messages
- Observability settings (for tracing and metrics)

---

### **Loading Configuration**

- **Environment Detection:** Uses the `ENVIRONMENT` environment variable (default: `development`) to support environment-specific configs.
- **Config Merging:** Attempts to merge a base config (`sidecar.yaml`) with an environment-specific override (e.g., `sidecar.development.yaml`).
- **Graceful Fallback:** If no config file is found, it logs a warning and relies on environment variables.
- **Unmarshal & Env Loading:** Loads config into the `Settings` struct, then overlays any environment variables (with the `SIDECAR_` prefix).
- **Validation:** Validates the final config and fails fast if invalid.

---

### **Environment Variable Support**

- Enables automatic environment variable binding.
- Uses the `SIDECAR_` prefix and replaces dots with underscores for nested fields (e.g., `SIDECAR_DATABASE_TYPE`).
- Explicitly binds all expected environment variables for clarity and reliability.

---

### **Error Handling**

- If config files are missing, it logs a warning and continues (allowing pure ENV-based config).
- If config is invalid or cannot be unmarshaled, it logs a fatal error and exits.

---

## **Summary**

This file demonstrates a best-practice approach for Go application configuration:
- **Flexible:** Supports YAML files, environment-specific overrides, and environment variables.
- **Safe:** Validates config before use.
- **User-friendly:** Provides clear error messages and fallback behavior.

You can use this pattern to make your Go services easy to configure in any environment—local, CI, or production!

---

**Example usage in your `main.go`:**
```go
cfg, err := config.LoadFromFile("/etc/myapp/")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to load config: %v", err)
}
```

---

**Tip:**  
This approach is especially useful for 12-factor apps and cloud-native deployments!
